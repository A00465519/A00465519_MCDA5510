## What brought us togther?

We've discovered that we are all travel bugs who love to explore places, meet new people, learn about new cultures and oh...of course try out new cuisines.

## Why are we here? (and a fun fact)

I, Vishnu Tej, am here to learn new skills and expand my current ones for the field of Data Analytics, gain exposure to the international corporate culture and hopefully have a good start to my career in Data Analytics. One fun fact about me is that I make a really mean omelette and that's pretty much where my culinary skills peak ðŸ˜€.
